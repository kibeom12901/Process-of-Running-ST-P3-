## 8/5/2024 Onwards - ST-P3 Workflow

![ST-P3 Workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21e01630-ca95-402f-baba-59b0b5e9aa7a)

### ST-P3 Framework Overview
- **Input:** Utilizes multiple camera views (`T-step N-view Camera`) capturing the environment around the vehicle over time.
- **High-Level Command:** Directs the vehicle’s actions, such as "Go Straight."

- **Backbone Network:**
  - Processes the camera inputs to extract front-view vision features.

- **Perception Module:**
  - Aligns and aggregates features in 3D space to create **Aligned BEV Features** (Bird’s Eye View) at different time steps (`t = 1` to `t = T`), preserving geometric information.

- **Prediction Module:**
  - Generates future scene representations over multiple time horizons (`H horizons`), using past variations to predict future outcomes.

- **Planning Module:**
  - Creates the final vehicle trajectory (**SDV Trajectories**) by integrating BEV features, scene predictions, and front-view vision features, guided by high-level commands.

### Data Generation for E2E Training
- Downloaded the entire NuScenes dataset using [this link](https://www.nuscenes.org/login?prevpath=download&prevhash=).

### Training the Perception Module
- Executed the following command to start Perception Module Pretraining:
    ```bash
    bash scripts/train_perceive.sh stp3/configs/nuscenes/Perception.yml data/Nuscenes
    ```
- Training approximately took 5 days with one Nvidia GPU.
- The model was trained up to Epoch 19, accumulating data from epochs 0.

### Prediction Module Training
- Began training the prediction module with the following command:
    ```bash
    bash scripts/train_prediction.sh stp3/configs/nuscenes/Prediction.yml data/Nuscenes ST-    P3/tensorboard_logs/30August2024at13_22_38KST_SimulationPC_Perception/default/version_0/checkpoints/last.ckpt
    ```

### Planning - Entire Model E2E Training
- Encountered a memory issue during this process, which was resolved by reducing the batch size to 1.
- Performed Planning model:
  - Once using the perception-trained model with 2 epochs to test an extreme case.
  - Once using the perception-trained model with 20 epochs.
  
    ```bash
    bash scripts/train_plan.sh stp3/configs/nuscenes/Planning.yml data/Nuscenes ST-P3/tensorboard_logs/30August2024at13_22_38KST_SimulationPC_Perception/default/version_0/checkpoints/last.ckpt
    ```
    
  - Once using the prediction-trained model with 20 epochs.

    ```bash
    bash scripts/train_plan.sh stp3/configs/nuscenes/Planning.yml data/Nuscenes ST-P3/tensorboard_logs/17September2024at18_15_56KST_SimulationPC_Prediction/default/version_0/checkpoints/last.ckpt
    ```
- The purpose was to compare and analyze differences between the models.

### Evaluation with Entire E2E Trained Model
- Executed the following command to start Evaluation:
    ```bash
    bash scripts/eval_plan.sh ${checkpoint} ${dataroot}
    ```

#### Evaluation of Perception-Trained Model with 2 Epochs (Extreme Case)

    bash scripts/eval_plan.sh tensorboard_logs/15August2024at11_08_45KST_SimulationPC2_Planning/default/version_0/checkpoints/last.ckpt data/Nuscenes
    
- The evaluation results show that the model’s performance varies across different metrics:
  - **Vehicle IoU:** The model shows moderate accuracy in identifying vehicles in the scene.
  - **Pedestrian IoU:** The model struggles with detecting pedestrians, as indicated by a lower IoU score.
  - **Lane Divider IoU:** The accuracy of lane divider detection is moderate, but there's room for improvement.
  - **Drivable Area IoU:** The model performs relatively well in identifying drivable areas, with a higher IoU score compared to other classes.
  - **Planning Metrics:**
    - The model demonstrates low collision probabilities with objects and bounding boxes within the first 1 to 3 seconds, indicating relatively safe trajectory planning.
    - However, the L2 distance error increases over time, suggesting that the predicted trajectories deviate more from the ground truth as the prediction horizon extends.
